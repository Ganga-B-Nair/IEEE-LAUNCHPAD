and fostering a culture of collaboration, I have successfully motivated and inspired individuals in 
the technology and startup sectors. My approach to leadership emphasizes teamwork, innovative problem-solving, 
and a commitment to ongoing learning.

#### Networking:


As a first-year student in Computer Science Engineering and a member of the IEDC Executive Committee, 
I am eager to connect with fellow students, experienced professionals, and mentors through technology events and 
collaborative endeavors. My goal is to establish robust networks by participating in community activities, 
exchanging ideas, and fostering innovative projects. By remaining active and setting a positive example, 
I hope to motivate others to explore, learn, and make meaningful contributions to our expanding tech community.

#### Career Plan:

As a first-year student, my immediate plan is to actively participate in IEDC activities, 
learn from startup events, and collaborate on innovative student projects that address real-world problems. 
In the long term, I aim to launch impactful tech-driven solutions, mentor upcoming innovators, and contribute 
to building a more vibrant and inclusive startup culture within the Kerala Startup Ecosystem.

#### Thoughts on Kerala's Tech Ecosystem:

As a first-year student, I am convinced that Kerala possesses significant potential 
to thrive in the technology startup landscape. This can be achieved by fostering young talent, 
promoting innovation within academic institutions, and increasing opportunities for practical experience.
By enhancing collaboration between industry and academia, providing accessible mentorship, and supporting 
student-driven initiatives, Kerala can cultivate a vibrant startup ecosystem that empowers future tech entrepreneurs.

#### History of Open Source Contributions:

I haven’t had the opportunity to contribute to open-source projects yet,
but I’m eager to start exploring this space. I’m currently learning how to contribute effectively 
and plan to work on projects that align with my interests, like web development and AI.

#### History of Community Engagement:
I’m just starting to engage with technical communities, 
and I’ve been exploring platforms like Discord to learn and share knowledge. 
While I haven’t contributed extensively yet, I’ve participated in discussions 
on tech-related team projects


#### Highly Visible Technical Content:
Currently, I have not created any technical blog posts,
articles, or video series. However,I am actively seeking 
opportunities to begin sharing my learning experiences and projects 
on platforms such as GitHub and LinkedIn. My intention is to provide valuable
content in fields such as UI/UX, cybersecurity, and web development as I acquire
more practical experience.
